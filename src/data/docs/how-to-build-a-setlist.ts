 * adding does, ordering, queue vs Setlist, editing, unavailable items,
 * deletion, visibility (private/shared/public), availability recheck,
 * collaboration, Workspace Setlists, playback, autoplay, discovery,
 * following, sharing, and a Setlist/Keep/Library comparison table.

 * Content provided verbatim by the user; structured into blocks. Uses a
 * 3-row comparison table, multiple numbered and bulleted lists, bold
 * lead-in items, and a note callout.
